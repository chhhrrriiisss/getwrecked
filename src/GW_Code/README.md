## Vehicle Combat Sandbox for Arma 3

Get Wrecked challenges players to create, customize, drive, survive and of course, destroy. Construct wheeled, armoured behemoths using a variety of building parts, then fight to the death in a race zone of choice. It's a creative vehicle combat sandbox for Arma 3. It's currently designed for small games of up to 16 players and is in an work-in-progress release state.

## Quick start

Get Wrecked is not a true "mod" as all the code is contained within one mission file. If you just want to play, the easiest way is to just find a server that's currently hosting the mission and join it. There is a [server list available on the website](http://getwrecked.info#play).

If you're looking to host a game yourself, it is strongly recommended to use a dedicated server to run Get Wrecked as aspects of the game mode can impact a client when they are also hosting. Simply [download the mission.pbo](http://getwrecked.info#download) and add it to your Arma3/MpMissions folder on your server. I highly recommend [TADST](http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=11655) as it is a quick and configurable way to run a server.

## Guide 

This isn't your typical infantry shooter and if you're coming from more mil-sim orientated game modes you're in for a surprise. A short guide is [available on the website](http://getwrecked.info#guide). [Orangesherbet](http://twitch.tv/orangesherbet) also has an [excellent tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL3aYOJD0fY&feature=youtu.be&a=) that introduces the basics, shows some game-play and also offers some tips for survival. 

## Bugs &amp; Issues 

From time to time you will encounter problems, most of which are usually fixed by rejoining the server. Please report any bugs you can easily replicate to the [github issues page](https://github.com/chrisnic/getwrecked-dev/issues). In the event you find a bug that persists after rejoining the server, you can use the !reset command in chat. Available commands are !reset money | unlocks | library | races | binds | all. Be aware this action is permanent and progress reset this way is not recoverable.
